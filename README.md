# E3PMarlinCustomBuild
Creality/Ender-3/BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 2.0 with Clone 3D Touch Sensor
This is just the configuration.h file which was edited for the particular 3D touch sensor clone I purchased.
This should work for all 3D/BL touch clones for the Ender-3 Pro with a BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 2.0.
The rest of the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3
DO NOT USE THE ABOVE FIRMWARE IF YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED A BTT MOTHERBOARD. Instead, go to https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin for stock Marlin firmware.
